Energy Charges: BPW will calculate the amount as a direct pass*through of the total amount the BPW pays to its wholesale electricity provider plus the local distribution system loss.  Specifically; all charges on the wholesale supplier bill; for energy; congestion; demand; and any other charges are added to a total dollar amount; then the total is divided by the total kWh amount and multiplied by the sum of one (1) plus the system loss.  This yields a purchased energy cost in cents per kWh.    Special Provisions   1. Primary meetering:  If the service is metered on the primary side of the transformers supplying the customer; 2% of the metered kilowatt hours will be deducted in computing the bill.  2. Facilities Ownership:  If the service is taken at the property line and the Company is relieved of owning and maintaining all electrical distribution equipment on private property; except the metering equipment; a credit shall be applied to the bill equal to $.20 per kW of the Distribution Demand billed.    Purchased Power Cost Adjustment * The purchase power cost adjustment (PPCA) to reconcile over or under collections of power supply costs will apply to all service supplied under this rate schedule.    Public Utilities Tax Surcharge * In addition to charges bu the BPW; the surcharge for Public Utilities Tax under Title 30; Part IV; Chapter 55; Section 5502 of the Delaware Code; if applicable; will apply to service rendered.
