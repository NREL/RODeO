The difference between the base cost and the annual cost per kWh estimated to be sold will be applied in the billing period. The Power Cost Adjustment will be calculated as follows                    PCA = A/B - C    This calculation will normally be made on a quarterly basis and a single Power Cost Adjustment billed for the entire quarter; although HMLP may change the Power Cost Adjustment more frequently if such changes are required.     *METERING: This rate shall apply only to service where metering is installed on the primary side of the transformer(s) supplying the Customer.,No comments,No voltage category given,12,1000000000,1000000000,1,0,0,1,1000000000,1000000000,1.00E+99,0,1.00E+99,0
